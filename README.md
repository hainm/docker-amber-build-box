To build docker image

# Notes
- The docker image will be automatically built in https://hub.docker.com/r/ambermd/amber-build-box/ if you make a commit here.
So please make careful change. If you want to play with it, you should make another branch.

# Usage example
- [ambertools-conda-build](https://github.com/Amber-MD/ambertools-conda-build/blob/master/scripts/run_docker_build.sh)
